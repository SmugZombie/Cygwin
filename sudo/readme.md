<strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
This allows you to launch an elevated cygwin session easily.
<br>
<strong>Usage:</strong><br>To use this you can simply launch it like a normal script, or you can make a bash alias like I did for "sudo" to automatically launch this
<br>
<strong>.bash_aliases:</strong><br>
scriptRoot="~/.scripts/"<br>
alias sudo="$scriptRoot/cygwinadmin.bat"
